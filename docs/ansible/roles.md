# Roles

## Embedding modules and plugins

Ansible Roles can also include embedded modules and plugins, so you don't necessarily need an Ansible Collection if you need to use a custom module or plugin in a Role. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#embedding-modules-and-plugins-in-roles
